Sure! I’ll generate a professional and clear `README.md` file for your project based on the content of your uploaded Jupyter Notebook (`Manav.ipynb`). First, let me check the contents of your notebook to understand what the project is about.


Thanks! Based on the initial cells, your project appears to be an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **IMDB Movie Dataset** using Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

# 🎬 IMDB Movie Data Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the [IMDB Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) using Python. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into movie trends, ratings, revenue, genre performance, and more.

## 📊 Project Objectives

* Understand the structure of the IMDB dataset
* Explore distributions of movie ratings, revenues, and metascores
* Analyze genre-based trends and correlations
* Visualize insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 📁 Dataset Used

* **File Name:** `IMDB-Movie-Data.csv`
* **Source:** Likely downloaded from [Kaggle IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* Contains metadata for 1000 popular movies on IMDB including:

  * Title, Genre, Director, Actors
  * IMDB Rating, Metascore
  * Revenue (Millions)
  * Year of release

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Explorations

* Overview of dataset structure (`shape`, `info`, `head`, etc.)
* Handling missing data
* Revenue trends over the years
* Rating distributions
* Genre-wise performance
* Correlation heatmaps

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the notebook:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manavdarji2/imdb-movie-eda.git
   ```
2. Open `Manav.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
3. Make sure `IMDB-Movie-Data.csv` is in the same directory.
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

> Include a few example plots here (like bar charts, heatmaps, histograms).

## 💡 Insights Gained

* Action movies dominated the box office revenues
* Strong positive correlation between IMDB ratings and metascore
* Year-wise movie production insights
